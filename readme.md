# OpenGL

This repo will be used to learn OpenGl, GLWF and SDL.

# Useful Links

This is where I learn this stuff :)

- https://learnopengl.com/ (the [book](https://learnopengl.com/book/book_pdf.pdf) is great!)
- https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.3/quick_guide.html

# Compile

It depends where you have installed the libraries, but if you're using a Mac M1, you can try with:

```
g++ -o a -I/opt/homebrew/include/ src/*.cpp main.cpp
```
