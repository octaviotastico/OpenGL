This repo will be used to learn OpenGL :)

# How to compile

If you use VSCode, you can just press Command+Shift+B, and thanks to the `tasks.json` file, you should get the binary file (called `openGL`).

There's also a Makefile now, so you can just `make` and then run `./openGL`.

After compiling and executing openGL, you should be able to see this image:

You can move around with **WASD**, look around using the **mouse**, and go up and down using **Shift** and **Space**.

# Libraries used

## GLFW

[GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) is used to create windows on different operative systems. It provides a simple API to create windows that can also receive user input.

## GLAD

[GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/) is used to load the addresses of different OpenGL functions.

## STB Image

[STB](https://github.com/nothings/stb) is used to load textures. It provides a simple API to be able to read image files in C++.
